# Full Stack Development Test - Week One

This assessment tests your understanding of loops, objects, arrays, and basic functions.

## Guidelines

- In case you copy previously written code, you should be able to explain it on the white board

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade  | Explanation              |
| :----: | -------------------------|
|   4    | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3    | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2    | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer. |
|   1    | I am struggling with this question. |
|   0    | I did not attempt this question (explain why) |

### 1. Palindrome

- Grade: 4 
- Explanation: I understood this as we had something similar with the string paramenter recently. 
I had to lookup online help to remind how to convert number to string to start with but after that I was fine. 

### 2. Add grid items

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: I remember learning on how to loop through nested arrays and I attempted to use this method but did not get anywhere near the correct answer. 
I am struggling to understand why my looped arrays are not storing the values to my variable. 

### 3. Create file name string in CamelCase

- Grade: 4
- Explanation: This was the easies of all exercises and I only had to look up online help to confirm my replace function was done correctly. 

### 4. Create pattern

- Grade:1
- Explanation: I have completed similar pyramid by looping through string but as this was numeric values that are different on each loop, I did not got the answer.
I also think my varaible is declared incorrectly but I cannot think ho to add the numbers without summing them. This was the most difficult of the exercises.
